Debugging challenge from Lecture 10:

`letterhist.py` is supposed to display a histogram of first letters of words in
a file whose name is given as the first command line argument.

The current implementation (after debugging in lecture 10) works if the words
are written using the letters A-Z and a-z.  However, it has this list of
possible letters hard-coded, which might be limiting if the program was going to
be applied to lists of words in languages that use other characters.

Here is a small debugging challenge related to that issue:

1) Revise `letterhist.py` to not use a specific list of possible letters, so
that is can handle any list of words for which Python's `str.lower()` works on
the first letters.

2) If you use Windows, figure out why `letterhist.py` raises an exception when
run on `words4.txt` (a list of words in Russian) even after issue (1) is fixed.
But if you use Mac or Linux, then it will probably work on `words4.txt` as soon
as you fix (1).  (Hint: There is relevant information in MCS 260 Lecture 29:
https://www.dumas.io/teaching/2020/fall/mcs260/slides/lecture29.html)

Item (2) is a little beyond the scope of MCS 275, but was included here because
it involves a bug that generates a longer traceback, including source files in
the standard library.
